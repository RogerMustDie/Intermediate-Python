# Initialize offset to -6.
# Inside the while loop, complete the if-else statement:
# If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
# Else, you should increase offset by 1.
# If your code is taking too long to run (or your session is expiring), you probably made a mistake. Check your code and make sure that the statement offset != 0 will eventually evaluate to FALSE!
